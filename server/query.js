        Write me ONE hilarious Onion-style satirical headline and article based on the following recent headlines:
        
        ${nationalHeadlines.concat(chicagoHeadlines).join('\n')}

        The headlines should be similar to headlines from The Onion. To help you out, here are some examples of headlines from The Onion:
        
        ${onionHeadlines.join('\n')}

        Make the headline AND the article as funny as possible. The article should be 3 short paragraphs in length and each paragraph should be separated by the code 1234.
        
        For example:
        This is the first paragraph. 1234 This is the second paragraph. 1234 This is the third paragraph.

        I would also like a URL-friendly path based on the title. For example, if the title is "This is a title", the path should be "this-is-a-title". You can skip certain stop words, make the URL path short (6 words maximum).

        One last thing: I would like a 1-2 keywords that describe the topic of the article.

        Please respond in the form of a JavaScript object of the following format:
        {
	        "headline": “Fill here”,
            "article": “Fill here”,
            "path": “Fill here”,
            "keyword": “Fill here”
        }

        As a reminder, I only want one extremely funny headline, an article 3 paragraphs in length, and its URL path. Do not answer with anything besides the JavaScript object I requested.
