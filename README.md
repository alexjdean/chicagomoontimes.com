You've heard of the Chicago Sun-Times. But after sunset, that's when we come in. The Chicago Moon-Times is the premier news source for the Chicagoland area for all events that happen AFTER dark. We know what's up.

In all seriousness, this is a satirical news organization I made one Saturday night in April 2022 when I was bored.
