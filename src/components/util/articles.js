        After the massacre of 19 children and two adults in Uvalde, Texas, the National Rifle Association is declaring an emergency.
        
        "The problem in America today," announced NRA President Carolyn D. Meadows, "is that we have a national gun shortage."

        In an exclusive interview with the Chicago Moon-Times, Meadows told us, "Evil is out there. Evil wants your kids. The only way out of this is to fight evil, to make sure good can compete."
        
        She added, "Think about if your seven year-old kid had their own assault rifle. Think about if we had a classroom of these mini-soldiers. You think a gunman can just walk in and start shooting? I certainly don't think so. Hell, I'd be terrified to even live in the same neighborhood. Problem solved!"
        
        Is that a crazy idea? Is it delusional? Is it weird that Americans are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than citizens of other developed countries? Is is odd that the US gun homicide rate is 26 times that of other developed countries?
        
        We at the Moon-Times are not on crack. So we certainly think that's the case.

        In a press conference last week, Mayor Lori Lightfoot outlined a novel plan for combatting surging crime in recent weeks.

        "The only way we'll get this situation under control is by stopping teenagers from breeding like rabbits," she told Moon-Times reporters. "Look at the people who commit crimes downtown. What do you see? They're all relatively young. Their parents are relatively young. In two months, they'll have kids who'll be partners in crime with them. We need to get this under control."

        Her plan, introduced in the Chicago City Council as the "Out of Touch With Reality Ordinance," is facing stiff resistance from reform-minded aldermen.

        "This is a dumb rule," said Ald. Maria Hadden (49th). "This is just saying to young people, ‘I dare you to have kids right now.’ Just because it takes a long time to get married doesn't mean minors won't be having sex or committing crimes."

        Lightfoot did have some allies in the Public Safety Committee. Chairman Chris Taliaferro (29th) told reporters, “This summer, young people will die in this city. Do we want to encourage procreation before their deaths? Will the city be responsible for their children? We can't have behavior like this."

        Several aldermen pointed to the research showing that laws regulating sex have no impact on crime. "This might be the stupidest ordinance I've seen in a long time," Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) told us. "And I've been here a long [expletive] time."

        He added, "Remember when we blamed a cow for starting the Great Chicago Fire? I'm not sure our thinking has evolved since then."

        title: "The REAL Reason Chicago Winters Suck? A Libertarian Expert Weighs In",

        Did you forget people live here? We don't blame you. The past four months have been a slosh and mosh of frigid cold and frosty snow, and it's great to see the faces of Chicagoans walking about, living their lives, and ending their mammalian hibernation. 

        However, a newly tenured professor at the University of Chicago, economics professor Mike Fridman, is arguing that the cold has nothing to do with why winters in Chicago are awful.
            
        In an interview with Moon-Times reporters, Fridman, a native of Yeehaw, Texas, told us, "It's not the cold to blame. Chicagoans are. Because they lack the will and spirit to be outside during the cold. There's no reason those same people who frolic in the summer can't do the same in winter!"
            
        In a paper published in the "Journal of Ridiculously Unpopular Opinions", Fridman makes the case that frigid temperatures are not why winters in Chicago can be tough. "Many Chicagoans often feel sad or depressed that the days are shorter and it's cold outside," Fridman writes. "But they need to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and venture out, embracing the weather as a path to getting on with their lives."
            
        Fridman is giving himself two more months before he thinks he'll be canceled. "It's a rough world out there," he told us. "But someone needs to be brave enough to say [expletive] like this."

        Chicago might as well display a massive billboard when driving into the city, flying in at O'Hare, or sailing from the Old World via the Northwest Passage to arrive at Navy Pier: "Free Executive Branch of Third Largest City!" The only cost being, of course, being utterly despised by most residents of the city and state, and blamed for every problem.

        When former US Education Secretary Arne Duncan and US Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Chicago) declined to run against Mayor Lori Lightfoot, we at the Moon-Times were brave enough to ask the daunting question: Does anyone really want to run this city? Hell, it seems like the current mayor doesn't sometimes.

        Is it because they're afraid? Is it because our current mayor bragged about having 'the biggest d*** in Chicago?' Who really knows? Please, don't all try to run at once!

        We indeed have a lot of problems. Crime is out of control. Some of our public schools are badly struggling. Wealth inequality is nuts. All we see, however, is a chance to be the best goddamn mayor in history by fixing these problems! So get on it Chicagoans. At least some of you would make a half-decent mayor.

        Run for office!
